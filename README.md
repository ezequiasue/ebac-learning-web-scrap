An Intro to Threading in Python: 

Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently. 
In a simple, single-core CPU, it is achieved using frequent switching between threads. 
This is termed context switching. In context switching, a thread's state is saved and another thread's state is loaded whenever any interrupt (due to I/O or manually set) takes place. Context switching takes place so frequently that all the threads appear to be running parallelly (this is termed multitasking).


The single thread assessment file was created without the concept of Multithreading, to compare with the execution of the file, assessment_multithreading.py
